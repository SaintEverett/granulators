<h2 align="left">What are they</h2>

###

<p align="left">These are granulators made in ChucK that are specifically designed to be used in multichannel arrays of various sizes. They have been tested from arrays of 2 speakers to 8, but they should work in larger arrangements. This repo also includes granulators that are encoded with ambisonics, allowing for spatialization with 2nd order ambisonic processing. Controls for these granulators can be found in "granucontrols.pdf"</p>
